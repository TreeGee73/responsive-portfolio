# responsive-portfolio

The purpose of this project is to build a basic site consisting of three web pages that can be used to showcase the developer and their work. Creating this type of site will allow the developer to give potential clients/employers some insight into the developer through an "About Me" page, an idea of their work through a "Portfolio" page, and a means of getting in touch with the developer via a "Contact" page. This site is an important tool in obtaining opportunities for employment.

The main formatting for the site utilizes bootstrap with supplimental CSS to "personalize" the site.

## Contact (contact.html)
For this page I utilized the standard bootstrap and the same CSS created for the index.html. I added a contact form to this page using two form imput fields, one text area, and a submit button. Additional scripting is required to make the contact form work as intended, but I wanted to add functionality to the button so I programmed it to open an email that would be sent to my email address. I also added to the CSS to improve the button size and margins for better display and to better align to the images given as examples.



## Portfolio (portfolio.html)
Same as the index.html and contact.html, I utilized
