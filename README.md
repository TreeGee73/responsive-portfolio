# responsive-portfolio

The purpose of this project is to build a basic site consisting of three web pages that can be used to showcase the developer and their work. Creating this type of site will allow the developer to give potential clients/employers some insight into the developer through an "About Me" page, an idea of their work through a "Portfolio" page, and a means of getting in touch with the developer via a "Contact" page. This site is an important tool in obtaining opportunities for employment.

The main formatting for the site utilizes bootstrap with supplimental CSS to "personalize" the site.



## References
To complete this project I used the following references:

* Provided images - utilized to confirm page layouts aligned to project requirements

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) website - utilized to garner a better understanding of bootstrap and to apply appropriate code for the layouts to achieve the project requirements

* Self Acquired Images - All images on the site are my personal images that have been created/edited for this project



## About Me (index.html)
For this page I started with the standard bootstrap styles, implimenting the dark themed nav bar. I personalized the page using a web optimized photo for the background and some additional colors to make the page "me". I encountered some issues with the margins using the base formatting so I tweaked those as well within the CSS to make the layout better align to the images given as examples. Added buttons for connecting with me on LinkedIn and GitHub.



## Contact (contact.html)
For this page I utilized the standard bootstrap and the same CSS created for the index.html. I added a contact form to this page using two form imput fields, one text area, and a submit button. Additional scripting is required to make the contact form work as intended, but I wanted to add functionality to the button so I programmed it to open an email that would be sent to my email address. I also added to the CSS to improve the button size and margins for better display and to better align to the images given as examples.



## Portfolio (portfolio.html)
Same as the index.html and contact.html, I utilized bootstrap and the CSS. I added placeholder images for eight futre portfolio images and links. The layout was designed using simple rows and columns and Cards. This results in five images arranged in two columns and three rows for displays larger than 767, and one column for displays 767 and smaller. I added additional styling to CSS to ensure display results align to the images given as examples. Because the cards included additional parameters, retained those parameters commented out for utilization in future updates if they make sense. Will assess and keep or remove with future updates.



## Challenges
While creating these pages I encountered several formatting challenges, especially on the portfolio page when making the layout responsive. I relied heavily on previous assignments and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) website to find solutions or alternatives for accomplishing the tasks given.
