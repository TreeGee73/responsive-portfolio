# responsive-portfolio

The purpose of this project is to build a basic site consisting of three web pages that can be used to showcase the developer and their work. Creating this type of site will allow the developer to give potential clients/employers some insight into the developer through an "About Me" page, an idea of their work through a "Portfolio" page, and a means of getting in touch with the developer via a "Contact" page. This site is an important tool in obtaining opportunities for employment.

The main formatting for the site utilizes bootstrap with supplimental CSS to "personalize" the site.
