## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a basic site consisting of three web pages that can be used to showcase the developer and their work. Creating this type of site allows the developer to give potential clients/employers insight into the developer through an "About Me" page, an idea of their work through a "Portfolio" page, and a means of getting in touch with the developer via a "Contact" page. This site serves as an important tool in obtaining opportunities for employment.

The main formatting for the site utilizes Bootstrap with supplemental CSS to personalize the site.

---

## Usage

This is a responsive portfolio website featuring three pages:
- **About Me** - Personal introduction and links to professional profiles
- **Portfolio** - Showcase of projects (placeholder images for future work)
- **Contact** - Form interface for connecting with the developer

## Technology

* **HTML** (93.1%) - Structure and content
* **CSS** (6.9%) - Custom styling and personalization
* **Bootstrap** - Responsive framework for layout and components

## About Me (index.html)

For this page I started with the standard Bootstrap styles, implementing the dark-themed nav bar. I personalized the page using a web-optimized photo for the background and additional colors to make the page unique. I encountered some issues with the margins using the base formatting, so I tweaked those within the CSS to make the layout better align to the example images provided. Added buttons for connecting via LinkedIn and GitHub.

---

## Contact (contact.html)

For this page I utilized the standard Bootstrap and the same CSS created for the index.html. I added a contact form to this page using two form input fields, one text area, and a submit button. Additional scripting is required to make the contact form work as intended, but I wanted to add functionality to the button so I programmed it to open an email that would be sent to my email address. I also added to the CSS to improve the button size and margins for better display and to better align to the example images provided.

## Portfolio (portfolio.html)

Same as the index.html and contact.html, I utilized Bootstrap and the CSS. I added placeholder images for eight future portfolio images and links. The layout was designed using simple rows and columns and Cards. This results in five images arranged in two columns and three rows for displays larger than 767px, and one column for displays 767px and smaller. I added additional styling to CSS to ensure display results align to the example images provided. Because the cards included additional parameters, I retained those parameters commented out for utilization in future updates if they make sense. Will assess and keep or remove with future updates.

## Challenges

While creating these pages I encountered several formatting challenges, especially on the portfolio page when making the layout responsive. I relied heavily on previous assignments and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) website to find solutions or alternatives for accomplishing the tasks given.
